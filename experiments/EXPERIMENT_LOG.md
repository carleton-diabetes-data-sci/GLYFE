# Experiment Log

While it would be nice to have a more automized system, 
instead we are going to manually record experiment runs
here. You might be tempted to skip this step because you
have confidence that you will remember later, or because
you're just mucking around. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP.

**Experiment name**: test_datalad
**Commit hash before the experiment**: 2c99e06
**Description**: Running some Ohio data through the base model just 
to test how datalad is working. 

**Experiment name**: test_datalad
**Commit hash before the experiment**: 9203e09
**Description**: Running some Ohio data through the polynomial 
model to test if datalad is working correctly through Erin's
user account. BAD PRACTICE TO HAVE ONE EXPERIMENT NAME FOR 
MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF THE CODE.

**Experiment name**: all_sap100
**Commit hash before the experiment**: 32e2d63
**Description**: The goal is to run all of De Bois's models on all of the SAP100
Tidepool data. We are not modifying the models in any way, so some of them might
fail. The big picture idea is to see if we get different results from a larger 
quantity of data.
