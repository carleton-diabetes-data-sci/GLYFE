[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/184261006.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/184261006)

GLYFE is a glucose predictive models benchmark. <!--It has been described in the paper "GLYFE: Benchmark of Personalized Glucose
Predictive Models in Type 1 Diabetes", published in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering.-->

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the data needed to run the benchmark as well as to develop new glucose predictive models.

### Prerequisites

To simulate the data need to run the benchmark, you will need a [MATLAB licence](https://fr.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and a [T1DMS licence](https://tegvirginia.com/software/t1dms/).

To run the benchmark, you will need the following ```Python 3.6``` libraries
```
Keras 2.2.4
numpy 1.15.4
pandas 0.23.4
pip 9.0.1
scikit-learn 0.20.1
scipy 1.1.0
setuptools 28.8.0
